# Ansible
Ansible playbooks

## Description
* Just a place where I put my own Ansible playbooks.
* They are written for Ubuntu 14 boxes (please, don't blame me)
* These playbooks are in a very early stage, so please be patient and let me improve them.
* Some files aren't uploaded due to security/privacy reasons ([.gitignore](.gitignore) rules). Anyway, I hope this code is pretty clear enough.

## To Do
* Add conditional statements in order to provide more compatibility
* Add *useful* features to Apache and MySQL playbooks.

## Credits

## Bonus
* A basic [Kickstart file for Ubuntu](kickstart-ubuntu-template.ks) created with `system-config-kickstart` Ubuntu tool. Yes, I should move to another place.
